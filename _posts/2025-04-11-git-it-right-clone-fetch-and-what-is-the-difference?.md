Git commands like `clone`, `fetch`, and `pull` can be confusing at first. They all help you get code from a remote source, but each works differently.Here weâ€™ll explain them in simple terms, so you know what to use and when.

### Clone vs Fetch vs Pull

âœ… 1. `git clone`
- Use `git clone` when you want to first time create a local copy or download the remote repository.

Example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

ðŸ”„ 2. `git fetch`
- Use `git fetch` when you want to check if there are any new updates made by others, without changing anything in your current work. It grabs the updates in the background but doesn't touch your files yet.

Example:
```bash
git fetch origin
```

ðŸ”€ 3. `git pull` â€“ Fetch + Merge
- Use `git pull` when You want to bring your local branch up to date with the remote branch.
-  It fetches changes and immediately merges them into your current branch.
- Before pulling, make sure to save or stash your local changes to avoid conflicts or errors

Example:
```bash
git pull origin main
```
### Git the Point? ðŸ˜‰
Now you know the difference between `clone`, `fetch`, and `pull`.

`Happy pulling`
