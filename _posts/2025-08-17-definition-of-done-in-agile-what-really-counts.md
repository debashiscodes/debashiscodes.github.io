Imagine you're a chef. When is a dish `done`?
- Cooked?
- Seasoned?
- Plated?
- Checked by the head chef?
- On the customer’s table?
- When the customer is happy?
- When bill has paid by the customer?

Without agreement, chaos reigns. Some dishes are sent out unfinished, others held too long. Customers get inconsistent experiences.

In software, it’s the same. Developers, testers, and product owners may have different ideas of "done," leading to half-finished features, bugs, and frustrated users. That’s why **Definition of Done (DoD)** exists.

### Why DoD Matters

- **Transparency:** Everyone knows what "complete" means.
- **Accurate Planning:** True requirements = better estimates.
- **Sustainable Pace:** Avoid “almost done” work piling up.
- **Incremental Delivery:** Each sprint produces shippable increments.

Without it:
- Features stuck at 90%
- Technical debt piles up
- Integration fails
- Bugs reach production
- Team friction grows

### Core Elements of DoD

- **Code Quality:** style guide, linting, peer review
- **Testing:** unit, integration, acceptance, security, performance
- **Documentation:** code comments, API docs, changelog
- **Deployment:** CI/CD green, feature flags, rollback plan

### Implementing DoD

1. **Collaborate:** Include devs, QA, DevOps, PO.
2. **Start simple, evolve:** Crawl → Walk → Run.
3. **Make it visible:** Boards, README, PR templates.
4. **Automate:** Tests, linters, security scans in CI.
5. **Review regularly:** Update DoD as the team matures.

### ⚡ TL;DR

DoD is your team’s quality promise. It turns “works on my machine” into “ready for customers.” Start small, be consistent, automate checks, evolve continuously. When implemented well, done really means done. ✅
