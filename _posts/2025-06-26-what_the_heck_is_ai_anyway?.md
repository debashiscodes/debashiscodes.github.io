AI is like giving a brain 🧠 to a machine 🤖, so it can do smart things just like people do.

💡 For example, AI is used in everyday life to:
* Understand voice commands – like Alexa responding to what you say.
* Recognize faces in photos – such as Facebook automatically tagging people.
* Drive cars automatically – like Tesla’s autopilot feature.
* Recommend content – for example, YouTube or Netflix suggesting videos based on your interests.
* Predict what you're typing – like when your phone suggests the next word as you type.
* Play music on command – you say “play music,” and your smart speaker plays your favorite song.

### AI can be categorized into 2 types:
1. Weak AI(Narrow AI)🧠
2. Strong AI(General AI)🧠💡
