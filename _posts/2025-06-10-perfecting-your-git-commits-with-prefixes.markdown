Have you ever been confused by a Git commit message, whether it's from a past teammate or on a recent pull request, struggling to understand what work was actually done?

The secret to a clean, understandable, and manageable Git history lies in well-crafted commit messages, especially when you add a  prefixe to your commit message.

### Why Prefixes?
Prefixes bring instant clarity and structure to your commit messages. They act as quick labels, telling anyone (including your future self!) what the commit is about at a glance. No more guessing if fixed bug refers to a `critical crash` or a `typo`!

### Common Prefixes
`feat` â€“ Adding a new feature

`fix` â€“ Fixing a bug

`chore` â€“ Routine tasks (e.g., build, config)

`refactor` â€“ Code restructuring without changing behavior

`docs` â€“ Documentation updates

`test` â€“ Adding or updating tests

`style` â€“ Code style changes (indentation, formatting)

### Example
`fix: Correct N+1 query in products index page`

`docs: Add comments to complex ActiveRecord query scopes`

`test: Add feature specs for user registration flow`

### Level Up Your Workflow! ðŸš€
Adopting prefixes might feel new, but it leads to a cleaner Git history, easier debugging, and faster code reviews. Start small, pick a few, and watch your commits transform!
