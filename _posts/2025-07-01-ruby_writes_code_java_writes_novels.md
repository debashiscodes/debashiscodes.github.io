In a tech conference, Java walks in, wearing a formal suit and carrying a huge 600-page manual.

Ruby is relaxed on a bean bag, wearing a hoodie, typing on a laptop, and calmly sipping a cup of AI (Adrak (ginger) and ilaichi (cardamom)) tea.

🗣️

**Java** (pompously):
Ah, Ruby. Still the language for hobby projects and failed startups?

**Ruby** (smirking):
Better than being the language for **banking apps no one dares refactor**.

🗣️

**Java**:
I’m strictly typed. That means I catch errors early.

**Ruby**:
You also catch **carpal tunnel early**. Ever heard of `duck typing`?
If it quacks, I trust it. You demand a pedigree and an ID card.

🗣️

**Java**:
Real developers like **type safety**.

**Ruby**:
Real developers like **getting work done** before they retire.

🗣️

**Java**:
At least I have **interfaces and design patterns**.

**Ruby**:
Yeah. You need a whole gang of patterns just to say “Hi”.
I just write:

```ruby
puts "Hi"
```
🗣️

**Java** (annoyed):
My syntax is explicit and verbose.

**Ruby**:
Your syntax is a legal contract with semicolons.
Mine is a love letter. Short, sweet, and it just works.

🗣️

**Java**:
I run billion-dollar systems.

**Ruby**:
Cool. I built the tools that built those billion-dollar systems.

🗣️

**Java**:
I’m battle-tested, enterprise-grade.

**Ruby**:
You mean enterprise-grade anxiety?
Enjoy writing a factory to build a singleton to configure your logger.

🗣️

**Java**:
People trust me. I’m serious and stable.

**Ruby**:
People use me because I’m productive and one man framework who can build from `Hello World` to `IPO`.
Also: rails new my_app — now I’ve built a blog. What have you done?

🗣️

**Java** (desperate):
You sacrifice control for simplicity!

**Ruby**:
You sacrifice joy for... what, stack traces?

🗣️

**Java**:
Fine. I guess we’re just different.

**Ruby** (grinning):
Exactly. You're a briefcase.
I'm a magic wand.
Keep writing your `public static voids`.
I’ll be over here, building apps before your compiler finishes warming up.
