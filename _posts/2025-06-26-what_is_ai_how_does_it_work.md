Imagine giving your computer a brain filled with intelligenceâ€”that's AI. It thinks, learns, and makes decisionsâ€”just like humans.

### AI can be categorized into 2 types:
1. Weak AI (Narrow AI)
2. Strong AI (General AI)

**Weak AI (Narrow AI)**

Weak AI (also called Narrow AI) is a type of artificial intelligence built to do one specific task, like:
- Answering questions
- Writing content
- Recognizing faces
- Recommending videos

It may seem smart, but it doesnâ€™t actually `understand` or `think` like a human â€” it just follows patterns and rules.

Examples:
- Siri or Alexa
- ChatGPT, Gemini

**Strong AI (General AI)**

Strong AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can `think`, `understand`, and `learn` like a real human.

It wouldnâ€™t just follow instructions â€” it would truly understand things, make its own decisions, and even feel emotions.

> **Important:** Strong AI does not exist yet. Itâ€™s still a goal for the future â€” more like science fiction for now.

### ðŸ‘‰ Levels of AI: From Zero to Superhuman
AI systems can be understood in `6 levels`, ranging from no intelligence to beyond human abilities:

1. Level 0: No AI
The system is fully manual and doesn't use any intelligence.

2. Level 1: Beginner AI
Works about as well as a new learner or unskilled person (like what we see in most AI today).

3. Level 2: Average AI
As good as a skilled human doing the job reasonably well.

4. Level 3: Expert AI
As smart and capable as top professionals in the field.

5. Level 4: Master AI
Better than almost all humans, performing at the `99% level`.

6. Level 5: Superhuman AI
Smarter and faster than any human on Earth.

### The Anatomy of AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is like an umbrella. Under it, there are smaller branches that go deeper and deeper. Letâ€™s break it down.
